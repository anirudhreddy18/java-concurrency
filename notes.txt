Process
code, data & state information
independent
there can be 100s of processes and os manages them

Thread
subset of process
a process can have multiple threads
light weight less overhead to create & terminate
os can switch b/w threads faster than processes

a java application runs in one process and can spin up multiple threads
each java app executes in its own instance of the JVM
each JVM instance is a separate independent process

by default java app takes 1 core and that is main thread

concurrency: it appears threads are running in parallel but only 1 thread can execute at a gievn time
Parallelism: it means using multi cores and multiple threads running at same time
